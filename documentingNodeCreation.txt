*** Documenting a simple and brief guide of what I've done to understand and improve the API.
*** Final objective is to have a working API that could be tested for security issues, etc.
**We can include security tests (security test library?)


After obtaining webstorm trial from the website jetbrains, I created a nodeJS project with express-generator with name of folder as nodeProject within the dir: ~\WebstormProjects\nodeProject
According to: https://share.merck.com/display/APITEAM/Project+structure#Projectstructure-Foldersandfiles the project structure will be as such. 
For now, create the structure in ~\WebstormProjects\nodeProject to as follows:
/
/bin
/node_modules
/public
/routes
/views
/config
/doc
/src
/test
/secret
app.js
package.json

For now, we'll press F6 in Webstorm, running the bin/www.js file.
Otherwise, you could also open bash and change dir to the aforementioned folder, then input command:
$ node bin/www 
However, using bash will not show the debug message. You could test if this is working by going to browser >
URL = localhost:3000
Next, I used postman to GET / and GET /users to test out the respond. So seeing that GET /users returns a message of 'respond with resource', we are going to change that to a json instead since we can see that there was nothing wrong with the generated node.

use POSTman to GET ~/users and you shold see the json reply.
Now before we add individual id sites, we are going to connect via mongodb, so go and download it from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/ and configure the basic settings. After you are done, run mongod.
We are going to use mongoose as the package to connect between our API and MongoDB. Go and download http://mongoosejs.com/docs/.
Created a new model.js in model folder. Then added to config.js the configuration for mongodb and for the port that was initially within bin/www.js
Connection for mongodb is done within bin/www.js, right when the nodeProject is run.
Created userModel.js file in ~/model dir. Now I'm going to start with changing the routes for users.js while adding GET and POST request for creating a new user through the schema
According to: https://share.merck.com/display/APITEAM/Error+Reporting+and+HTTP+status+codes. Added a status code for successful creation 201 and for failure of finding the object at 204
You could follow this: https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4 for adding the POST PUT GET and DELETE, all adding to the users.js file.

After all those, what I did was to push onto github, as a form of learning for git, to Release/1.0


Now continuing with Release/1.1 today, we'll be adding more features as a major version.

Firstly, we'll try to add in a error reporting function since it is very important.
We'll do it according to:
https://share.merck.com/display/APITEAM/Error+Reporting+and+HTTP+status+codes
Instead of using the default mongoose error handler, we'll use a custom one that creates a certain message and passing it onto the errorhandler that we'll be customising.

We are releasing this error handler along with DELETE/PUT/GET/PUSH operations as release/1.1

Now, we'll configure the API accordingly to: https://share.merck.com/display/APITEAM/API+Naming+Conventions
First, as part of the collection properties, we should have count and totalCount accordingingly. Let's program that.

Thus, concludes our release/1.2

Release/1.3
Added versioning

Today, we are going to try and include test cases, simple ones according to the guides online. But first, we'll try it out ourselves and see how it goes.
https://www.sitepoint.com/unit-test-javascript-mocha-chai/
We are gonna follow the instructions here, using mocha and chai. As well as using supertest https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest
Deleted versioning. Too troublesome.
http://www.scotchmedia.com/tutorials/express/authentication/1/06 for testing of mongoose connection to dB
We'll be trying first, the connection to dB and that every commands are as they should be. Basic tests is up. Time to push.


Before that, to know what should be tested, we should try using istanbul to see if code is covered by the test cases.

//Today, we're gonna try and configure Jenkins on our own environment for CI of the app, such that every time we do a certain task, it will be automatically pushed to github.
