After obtaining webstorm, create a nodeJS project with express generator, name of folder as nodeProject within the dir: ~\WebstormProjects\nodeProject

According to:
https://share.merck.com/display/APITEAM/Project+structure#Projectstructure-Foldersandfiles the project structure will be as such. Thus for now, we will rename app.js to index.js while refactoring it in webstorm.
For now, create the structure in ~\WebstormProjects\nodeProject to as follows:
/
  /bin
	/node_modules
	/public
	/routes
	/views
  /config
	/doc
	/src
	/test
	/secret
	index.js
	package.json
	
For now, we'll press F6 in webstorm, running bin/www.js file. Otherwise, you could also open bash and change dir to the aforementioned folder, then input command:
$ node bin/www 
However, using bash will not show the debug message. You could test if this is working by going to browser > url: localhost:3000

Next, I used postman to GET / and GET /users to test out the respond. So seeing that GET /users returns a message of 'respond with resource', we are going to change that to a HALSON instead.

The model we are adopting will be from this particular site: https://github.com/seznam/halson Thus, go ahead and npm install halson --save

You can test out the example on the github website with node REPL.

now edit ~/routes/users.js adding in a halson object while replacing the the response to res.send(resource). (resource is the halson link)

use POSTman to GET ~/users and you shold see the json reply.

Now before we add individual id sites, we are going to connect via mongodb, so go and download it from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/ and configure the basic settings. After you are done, run mongod.

We are going to use mongoose as the package to connect between our API and MongoDB. Go and download http://mongoosejs.com/docs/

Created a new model.js in model folder. Then added to config.js the configuration for mongodb and for the port that was initially within bin/www.js 

Connection for mongodb is done within bin/www.js, right when the nodeProject is run.

Created userModel.js file in ~/model dir. Now I'm going to start with changing the routes for users.js while adding GET and POST request for creating a new user through the schema

Added a status code for successful creation 201 and for failure of finding the object at 204
